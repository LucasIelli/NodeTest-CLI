# Holiday terminal app

## Hello and welcome !

<img src="hello-world.gif" alt="Hello World !" style="height: 120px; width:150px;"/>

### <u>What is this project?</u>

This very little app was made to train my `node` skills and displayed on a terminal. Before going on `react` during my course at [BeCode](https://becode.org/). Just after 4 weeks only on `Php` ! So, a little remind for `JS` :D

### <u>What you can do with it?</u>

You'll be able to ask to the app the holidays and the year for a specific country, after the ressources you got the [instructions](#instructions).

### <u></a>Ressources :</u>

- I took the API country-list from [Nager](https://date.nager.at/api/v3/PublicHolidays/2021/BE).
- For the http request [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).
- I used [Chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) for the colors.
- I used [Figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet) for the title.
- To be honest, I tried to use [Ora](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ora).

### <u><a name="instructions"></a>How to use it?</u>

1. Make sure you got npm and node installed, that's better if you got the latest version.
2. From your terminal, go in the folder and use `npm install` it'll install all the packages I used to create this app.
3. You have now these two following commands :

- `node . country-you-want year-you-want`
- `node . country-you-want`
- As an example for my country and my birthdate : `node . belgium 1993`
- NB : if you don't type any year it'll show the holidates for the current year.

### <u>Still WIP</u>

I'm working on a version 1.0.1 to solve the issue of countries with 2-3-4 words.
Second issue, I want to use the library Ora, will come asap. And yes, I'm learning now so any help is welcome !
